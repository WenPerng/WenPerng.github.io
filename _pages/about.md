Hello there! This is Wen Perng, a current bachelor student from National Taiwan University, Taiwan. My current study and research at NTU is under the guidance of professor [Homer H. Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FhmQz0MAAAAJ&hl=en), targeting on topics related to light fields and Fourier optics.

During the summer of 2025, I was an intern student at the Adaptive Systems Lab, EPFL, Switzerland. My work was on analyzing the performances of a multiplayer, multi-team game on networks.
