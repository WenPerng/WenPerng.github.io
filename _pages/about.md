Hello there! This is Wen Perng, a current bachelor student from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taiwan. My interest is in the field of optimization and the related learning theory, information theory. Furthermore, I'm also mildly interested in (differential) geometry and its applications in information science.

My current study and research at NTU is under the guidance of professor [Homer H. Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FhmQz0MAAAAJ&hl=en), targeting on topics related to light fields and Fourier optics.

During the summer of 2025, I was an intern student at the [Adaptive Systems Lab](https://asl.epfl.ch/), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. My work was on the theoretical analysis of performances of multi-team (multi-cluster, multi-network) game.
