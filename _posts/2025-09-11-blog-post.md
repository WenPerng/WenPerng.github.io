Continue from [last post](/posts/2025/09/blog-post-10/) where I discussed about Riemannian manifold optimizaiton, I extend my discussions on [steepest descent on normed vector spaces](/posts/2025/09/blog-post-07/) to normed manifolds.

I write this post after reading the works from [this site](https://docs.modula.systems/algorithms/manifold/). I do not like their formulation and introduction there. Hence, I decide to derive similar results from ground up in my own words.
