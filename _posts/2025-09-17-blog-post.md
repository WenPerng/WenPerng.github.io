excerpt: "This post discusses a result on the Robbins-Monro step-size condition which guarantees convergence under a stochastic gradient descent."

In dealing with iterations of the form
<p>

$$
x_{t+1} = x_{t} - \mu \boldsymbol{g}_t,
$$
</p>
the iteration might not converge given a fixed step-size \\(\mu\\) and a gradient with noise \\(\boldsymbol{g} _t\\).
