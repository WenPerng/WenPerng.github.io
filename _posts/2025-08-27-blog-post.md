This post gives the proofs to two useful matrix inversion lemmas, the Woodbury formula that inverts matrix of the form \\(A+UCV\\), and the inverse of a \\(2\times2\\) block-partitioned matrix. Without further adieu, let's get on with them.

# Woodbury's formula
The Woodbury matrix inversion formula is of the form
<p>

$$\boxed{
(A+UCV)^{-1} = A^{-1} - A^{-1}U(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U)^{-1} V A^{-1}}.
$$
</p>

## Proof
The proof is as below:


## Example
This lemma is especially useful is the size of \\(A\\) is large, but the size of \\(C\\) is small.

Consider
