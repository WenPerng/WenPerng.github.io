excerpt: "This post continues on with the matrix differentiation I introduced in one of my [talks](/talks/2024-09-18-talk) in NTUEE into complex fields. We elaborate on how one can differentiate with respect to complex vectors. And in the end, we will also discuss the Lagrange multiplier in this setting."

This post continues on with the matrix differentiation I introduced in one of my [talks](/talks/2024-09-18-talk) in NTUEE into complex matrices. We will be considering scalar functions of complex variables: \\(g = g(z_1,\ldots,z_n) \in \mathbb{C}\\), where \\(z_k\in\mathbb{C}\\). But first let us vectorize the complex variables: I use bold symbols to denote vectors and let \\(\boldsymbol{z} = [z_1,\ldots,z_n]^{\mathsf{T}}\\), then
<p>

$$
\boldsymbol{u} = \left[\begin{matrix}
  \boldsymbol{z} \\ \boldsymbol{z}^*
\end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
  \boldsymbol{x} + \mathrm{i} \boldsymbol{y} \\ \boldsymbol{x} - \mathrm{i} \boldsymbol{y}
\end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
	\mathbb{I}_n & \mathrm{i}\,\mathbb{I}_n \\ \mathbb{I}_n &-\mathrm{i}\,\mathbb{I}_n
\end{matrix}\right] \left[\begin{matrix}
  \boldsymbol{x} \\ \boldsymbol{y}
\end{matrix}\right] = D \boldsymbol{v},
$$
</p>
where \\(\boldsymbol{x}\\) and \\(\boldsymbol{y}\\) are real vectors of size \\(n\times1\\). The matrix \\(D\\) satisfies
<p>
$$DD^{\mathsf{H}} = 2\mathbb{I}_{2n}.$$
</p>
For a function \\(g(\boldsymbol{u})\\), we denote its realized version as \\(f\\):
<p>
	g(\boldsymbol{u}) = f(\boldsymbol{v}).
