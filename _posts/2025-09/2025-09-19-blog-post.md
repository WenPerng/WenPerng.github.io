> This post contains the derivation of the eigenvalues to some special matrices that relates to spring-mass systems. The derivation of some relies on recurrence relations.

In finding the normal mode frequency of a spring-mass system, one can turn differential equations into difference equations (recurrence relations) by plugging in an Ansatz. The Ansatz is parameterized by the normal mode frequency. Then, the difference equations can be rewritten into a matrix equation of the form \\(Wx=0\\) with the existence of non-trivial solutions relying on the determinant of \\(W\\) being \\(0\\). The form of \\(W\\) is \\(W = A - \lambda \mathbb{I}\\), where \\(\lambda\\) relates to the normal mode frequency. This is equivalent to having \\(\lambda\\) as the eigenvalues to \\(A\\).

In this post, we will be discussing four special cases of \\(A\\) and compute their eigenvalues.

# Spring-mass ring
The spring-mass chain forms a ring. The equation of motion for the \\(n\\)th particle is
<p>

$$
m \ddot{x}_n = -k(x_{n} - x_{n-1}) - k(x_{n} - x_{n+1}).
$$
</p>
Plugging in the normal mode Ansatz \\(x _n = a _n \cos(\omega t)\\) and set \\(\lambda = \omega^2 m / k\\). An implicit boundary condition is \\(x _0 = x _{N} \\). We can see that in this scenario, the \\(\lambda\\)'s are the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(A\\) defined as
<p>

$$
A = \left[\begin{matrix}
    2 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0& -1 \\
    -1 & 2 & -1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & 2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 2 & -1 \\
    -1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 2
\end{matrix}\right]_{N\times N}.
$$
</p>
One can notice that
<p>

$$
A = 2 \mathbb{I}_N - \mathbb{J}_N - \mathbb{J}_N^\mathsf{T}
$$
</p>
where \\(\mathbb{J} _N\\) is the permutation matrix
<p>

$$
\mathbb{J}_N = \left[\begin{matrix}
    0 & 1 & & & 0 \\
    & 0 & 1 \\
    & & \ddots & \ddots \\
    & & & \ddots & 1 \\
    1 & & & & 0
\end{matrix}\right].
$$
</p>
Since \\(\mathbb{J} _N^{-1} = \mathbb{J} _N^\mathsf{T}\\), if the former has the eigenvalue-eigenvector pair \\((\lambda,v)\\), then the latter has the eigenvalue-eigenvector pair \\((1/\lambda,v)\\). The computation of the eigenvalue can thus be separated. It can be easily found by induction that the characteristic polynomial to \\(\mathbb{J} _N\\) is \\(\lambda^N - 1\\). Thus, we have the eigenvalues to \\(A\\) being
<p>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \lambda_k &= 2 - \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{N}k} - \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{N}k} \\
    &= 2 - 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}k\right) \;\;\;\;\;(k = 1\sim N) \\
    &= 4 \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{N}k\right) \;\;\;\;\;(k = 1\sim N).
\end{aligned}
$$
</p>

# Spring-mass chain between two walls
Both ends to a spring-mass chain are fixed. The particles satisfy the same equation of motion. However, the boundary conditions are now modified to
<p>

$$x_0(t) = x_{N+1}(t) = 0.$$
</p>
This means that we have the matrix \\(A\\) is
<p>

$$
A = \left[\begin{matrix}
    2 & -1 \\
    -1 & 2 & -1 \\
    & -1 & 2 \\
    & & & \ddots & -1 \\
    & & & -1 & 2
\end{matrix}\right]_{N\times N}.
$$
</p>
This is a Toeplitz matrix.

Unlike for the previous case where the eigenvalue can be separated into the sum of the eigenvalues of three easy-to-calculate matrices, the calculation of the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix is much more intricate.

Instead of using the techniques from linear algebra, let us instead revert back to the recurrence equation to find a solution. Using the same definition for \\(\lambda\\), the recurrence relation \\(a _n\\) satisfies is
<p>

$$
(2-\lambda) a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}.
$$
</p>
Using the *characteristic method* for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations, we plug in the Ansatz of \\(a_n = r^n\\) and obtain
<p>

$$
r^2 - (2-\lambda) r + 1 = 0.
$$
</p>
There are two solutions, \\(r _1\\) and \\(r _2\\), satisfying \\(r _1 + r _2 = 2 - \lambda\\) and \\(r _1 r _2 = 1\\). The general solution will be
<p>

$$
a_n = \alpha_1 r^n + \alpha_2 r^{-n}.
$$
</p>

Next, we plug in the initial conditions:
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    &\because a_0 = 0 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2, \\
    &\therefore \alpha_1 = \alpha = -\alpha_2, \\
    &\because a_{N+1} = 0 = \alpha \left(r^{N+1} - r^{-(N+1)}\right), \\
    &\therefore r^{2N+2} = 1, \\
    &\Rightarrow r = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \frac{\pi}{N+1}k} \;\;\;\;\;(k = 1\sim 2N+2).
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
However, note that \\(r\\) and \\(r^{-1}\\) may coincide, we can thus reduce the range of \\(k\\) to \\(k=1\sim N+1\\). Further, if \\(k=N+1\\), \\(r = r^{-1}\\), we will obtain \\(a_n = 0\\) which is not desired. Hence, \\(k=1\sim N\\). Lastly, we have
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    \lambda &= 2 - (r_1 + r_2) \\
    &= 2 - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{N+1} k\right) \;\;\;\;\; (k = 1\sim N) \\
    &= 4\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2(N+1)} k\right) \;\;\;\;\; (k = 1\sim N).
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
These are the eigenvalues to \\(A\\).

# Spring-mass chain with one end fixed and another end free
Suppose the first mass is the one with spring connected to the wall and the \\(N\\)th one is the one on the free end. For this case, the matrix \\(A\\) is 
<p>

$$
A = \left[\begin{matrix}
    2 & -1 \\
    -1 & 2 & -1 \\
    & -1 & \ddots \\
    & & & 2 & -1 \\
    & & & -1 & 1
\end{matrix}\right]_{N\times N}.
$$
</p>
and the boundary conditions become
<p>

$$a_0 = 0, a_{N+1} = a_{N}.$$
</p>

Similarly using the characteristic method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations, the general solution will be \\(a _n = \alpha _1 r ^n + \alpha _2 r ^{-n} \\). We can plug in the boundary conditions to obtain 
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    &\because a_0 = 0, \\
    &\therefore a_n = \alpha \left(r^n - r^{-n}\right), \\
    &\because a_{N+1} = \alpha \left(r^{N+1} - r^{-N-1}\right) = a_{N} = \alpha \left(r^N - r^{-N}\right), \\
    &\therefore r^{N+1} - r^N = - (r^{-N} - r^{-N-1}), \\
    &\therefore r^{2N+1} = -1 \;\;\;\;\;(r\neq0), \\
    &\therefore r = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \frac{\pi}{2N+1}(2k-1)} \;\;\;\;\;(k = 1\sim N).
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
There should be \\(2N+1\\) solutions for \\(r\\). By the same argument as the last section, however, we can reduce it down to \\(N\\). The eigenvalues \\(\lambda\\) of \\(A\\) are finally obtained as
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    \lambda 
    &= 2 - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2N+1} (2k-1)\right) \;\;\;\;\; (k = 1\sim N) \\
    &= 4\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2(N+1)} \left(k-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) \;\;\;\;\; (k = 1\sim N).
\end{align*}
$$
</p>

# Spring-mass chain with two ends free
For this case, the matrix \\(A\\) is 
<p>

$$
A = \left[\begin{matrix}
    1 & -1 \\
    -1 & 2 & -1 \\
    & -1 & \ddots \\
    & & & 2 & -1 \\
    & & & -1 & 1
\end{matrix}\right]_{N\times N}.
$$
</p>
and the boundary conditions become
<p>

$$a_0 = a_1, a_{N+1} = a_{N}.$$
</p>

Similarly using the characteristic method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations, the general solution will be \\(a _n = \alpha _1 r ^n + \alpha _2 r ^{-n} \\). We can plug in the boundary conditions to obtain 
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    &\because a_0 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = \alpha_1 r + \alpha_2 r^{-1} = a_1, \\
    &\therefore \alpha_1 r = -\alpha_2, \\
    &\because a_{N+1} = \alpha_1 r^{N+1} + \alpha_2 r^{-N-1} = \alpha_1 r^{N} + \alpha_2 r^{-N} = a_N, \\
    &\therefore r^{N+1} - r^{-N} = r^N - r^{-N+1}, \\
    &\therefore r^{N+1} - r^N = r^{-N} - r^{-N+1}, \\
    &\therefore r^{2N} = -1, \\
    &\therefore r = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \frac{\pi}{N} k} \;\;\;\;\;(k=1\sim N).
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
The eigenvalues \\(\lambda\\) of \\(A\\) are
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    \lambda 
    &= 2 - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{N} k\right) \;\;\;\;\; (k = 1\sim N) \\
    &= 4\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2N} k\right) \;\;\;\;\; (k = 1\sim N).
\end{align*}
$$

The interplay between recurrence relations and Toeplitz-like matrices are truly fascinating. Originally, one uses the latter to solve for the former. However, as we have seen with the last three examples, we can actually turn this relation around and find the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz-like matrices using recurrence relations!
