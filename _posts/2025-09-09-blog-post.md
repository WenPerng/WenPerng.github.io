excerpt: "This post discusses the stability of the order k Newton-Schulz iteration for finding matrix inverses."
---

The \\(k\\)th order Newton-Schulz iteration for finding inversion of the matrix \\(A\\), denoted by \\(X\\) is defined as
<p>

$$
X_{t+1} = X_{t} \sum_{n=0}^{k} (\mathbb{I} - AX_{t})^n.
$$
</p>

A fix point of the above iteration is \\(X_t = A^{-1}\\). Our task is to find the convergence rate of \\(X_t\\) to \\(A^{-1}\\) and the range of suitable initial conditions.

# Convergence analysis
Notice that as \\(k\rightarrow\infty\\), it is necessary that we have \\(||\mathbb{I} - AX_t|| < 1\\) for the infinite series to converge. Henceforth, for the \\(k\\)th order Newton-Schulz algorithm to converge, a sufficient condition will also be to require
<p>

$$
\|\mathbb{I} - AX_t\| < 1,
$$
</p>
where \\(||\cdot||\\) can be any matrix norm with \\(||\mathbb{I}|| = 1\\).
