excerpt: "This post discusses the stability of the order k Newton-Schulz iteration for finding matrix inverses."
---

The \\(k\\)-th order Newton-Schulz iteration for finding inversion of the matrix \\(A\\), denoted by \\(X\\) is defined as
<p>

$$
X_{t+1} = X_{t} \sum_{n=0}^{k} (\mathbb{I} - AX_{t})^n.
$$
</p>

Again consider the SVD of \\(A\\) as \\(U\Sigma V^{\mathsf{H}}\\), and the SVD of \\(X_{t}\\) is \\(VS_tU^{\mathsf{H}}\\). Then the Newton-Schulz iteration above can be written as
<p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    VS_{t+1}U^{\mathsf{H}} &= VS_{t}U^{\mathsf{H}} \sum_{n=0}^{k} (\mathbb{I} - U\Sigma S_{t}U^{\mathsf{H}})^n \\
    &= V \left(S_t \sum_{n=0}^{k} (\mathbb{I} - \Sigma S_{t})^n \right) U^{\mathsf{H}} \\
    \Rightarrow S_{t+1} &= S_t \sum_{n=0}^{k} (\mathbb{I} - \Sigma S_{t})^n.
\end{align*}
$$
</p>

Since both \\(\Sigma\\) and \\(S_t\\) are diagonal, the diagonal elements follows independently the iteration of the form below:
<p>

$$
s_{t+1} = s_t \sum_{n=0}^{k} (1-\sigma s_{t})^n,
$$
</p>
where \\(\sigma\\) is one of the singular values of \\(A\\). Our task is to find the convergence rate of \\(s_t\\) to \\(1/\sigma\\) and the range of suitable initial conditions.
