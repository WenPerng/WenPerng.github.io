# Information geometry: the basics
Now before we illustrate how the two different edges come about, let us go for a detour into the beautiful theory of information geometry. We will be disucssing some of its basics here.

## Exponential family
Consider \\(\mathcal{M}\\) to be a *family* of probability distributions, the exact form to \\(\mathcal{M}\\) is discussed in just a minute. A distribution \\(P \in \mathcal{M}\\) can be represented in multiple ways. A trivial way is to just list down all the probabilities at each point in a vector is the support of \\(P\\) is finite. However, we consider an even more general case. A really important family of distributions is the *(natural) exponential family*.

Let \\(\mathcal{M}\\) be the exponential family, any distribution \\(P\\) in the exponential family can be determined by a set of parameters \\(\theta\\) (which is a finite-dimensional vector), written in the form of
<p>
$$\begin{align}
	P(x \vert {\color{teal}\theta}) &= \exp\left({\color{teal} \theta}^{\mathsf{T}} T(x) + k(x) - {\color{teal} \psi(\theta)}\right) \\
	&= \frac{1}{\color{teal} Z(\theta)} \exp\left({\color{teal} \theta}^{\mathsf{T}} T(x) + k(x)\right).
\end{align}$$
</p>
I know this is a complicated formula, but let me define each term for you. The terms in \\(\textcolor{teal}{\text{teal}}\\) are those that are related to the parameter \\(\theta\\). The term \\({\color{teal} \theta}^{\mathsf{T}} T(x)\\) represents the intertwining term between \\(x\\) and \\(\theta\\). The term \\(Z = \mathrm{e}^{\psi}\\) is the *partition function* or the normalization term of the distribution, and it is of our utmost interest!

The function \\(\psi(\theta)\\) is convex in \\(\theta\\)! This is because
$$
\begin{align*}
	\psi(\theta) = \log Z(\theta) = \log \int \exp\left(\theta^{\mathsf{T}} T(x) + k(x)\right)\, \mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
$$
