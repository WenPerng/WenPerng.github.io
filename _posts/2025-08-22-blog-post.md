In the last blog on mirror descent, we mentioned how we can treat Bregman divergences as squared distances, but without any further explanations! Therefore, this post is to elaborate on it. This is a basic result from information geometry, a subject under information theory that utilizes the tools from differential geometry. However, do not worry, as this post contains nothing from differential geometry nor information theory.
