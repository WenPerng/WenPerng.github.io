excerpt: 'This is a simple blog post on explaining why mirror descent is called "mirror" descent. In short, the mirror descent can be seen as a descent method in the *mirror space*!'

The reason we call the mirror descent the "mirror" descent is because it can be viewed as a usual descent method in the *mirror space*.

# The gradient is NOT a vector
Consider \\(g_t\\) as the gradient of our target loss function (to be minimized) evaluated at the point \\(x_{t-1}\\). In the usual gradient descent over \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\), we write the next iterate point as \\(x_t = x_{t-1} - \eta g_t\\). However, as we have seen in [manifold optimization](/talks/2024-10-01-talk), more often then not, \\(x_{t-1}\\) and \\(g_t\\) does not live in the same space where their addition makes sense! But for now, we will only consider mirror descent over a vector space \\(V\\) to make matters simple.

Recall that for a given function \\(\ell : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\) defined on a vector space \\(V\\), we define its gradient at a point \\(x\in V\\) to be a *linear functional* \\(\langle g , \cdot \rangle\\) that satisfies
\\[
    \frac{\mathrm{d} \ell}{\mathrm{d} x} [h] = \langle g , h \rangle
\\]
for all tangent vectors \\(h \in T_x V\\). The tangent space \\(T_x V\\) of a vector space is identical to itself, hence we have \\(T_x V = V\\). All linear functionals defined on a vector space \\(V\\) constitue its *dual space* \\(V^\*\\) (sometimes[^1] also denoted as \\(V^\vee\\)). In the case of the dual space to a tangent space, we often denote it as \\(T^\*_xV\\), \\( (T_xV)^\* \\), or \\( (T_xV)^\vee \\), and call it the *cotangent space* of \\(V\\). Note that since \\(T_x V = V\\), we have \\(T_x^\* V = V^\*\\).

|            | Vector Space  | Dual Space              |
| :--------- | :-----------: | :---------------------: |
| Notation   | \\(V\\)       | \\(V^\*\\)              |
| Vector     | vectors       | dual vectors, covectors |
| Components | contravariant | covariant               |

 Further note that although for finite dimensional \\(V\\), the two vector pacesThe table above shows that the usual *vectors* are those that reside in the vector space, while we call those that reside in the dual space the *covectors*. A gradient is a covector, it lives in a different space as the point \\(x\\), hence it cannot be added onto the point.

 The mirror descent, then, is to apply descent methods in the dual space, also known as the mirror space in this context.

 # Mirror map
 consider a strictly convex function \\(F\\), we will use it to create a *mirror map* that maps a point in the primal space, the original vector space \\(V\\), to the mirror space, the dual space \\(V^\*\\).
