excerpt: "Besides the exponential family, another type of important family of distributions is the mixture families. This post gives some illustration to the \\(e\\)- and \\(m\\)-properties in information geometry, finally giving an example on interpreting the forward and backward KL divergence."

Besides the exponential family that we talked about [last time](/posts/2025/08/blog-post-5/), the *mixture family* that I am about to introduce you to right now is also fairly important.

The exponential family together with the mixture family completes the view on the *flat structures* of some information manifolds.

# Mixture family
Given a set of distributions \\(\\\{q_k(x)\\\}_{k=0}^{n}\\), an element in the mixture family is given by
<p>
$$
p(x\vert\eta) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \eta_k q_k(x),
$$
</p>
where the coordinates \\(\eta_k>0\\) satisfy
<p>
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \eta_k = 1.
$$
</p>
This is obviously an \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold.
