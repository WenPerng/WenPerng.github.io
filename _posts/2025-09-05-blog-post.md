excerpt: "Note on \"[Introduction to Manifolds](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-7400-6)\" by Loring Tu -- especially on the functorial view of pushforward and pullback maps"

I enjoyed a really nice talk with my friend Willie Lee from ENS, Paris, on the first of September. We talked a bit on category theory and sheaves.

This post collects some idea of mine on category theory, both from the book by Loring Tu and from the chat I had.

# Elements of category theory
A *category* \\(\mathcal{C}\\) is a collection of *objects*. Between any two objects \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(\mathcal{C}\\), we have maps between them called the *morphisms* \\(\mathrm{Mor}(A,B)\\).

Consider \\(\mathcal{C}\\) as the collection of vector spaces and the morphisms contain all linear maps. This forms a category. For vector spaces \\(V, W\in\mathcal{C}\\), we have that \\(\mathrm{Mor}(V,W) = \mathrm{Hom}(V,W)\\).

# Functors
A functor is map between categories. It maps both the objects and morphisms of a category to another category.

Depending on how the morphisms' directions are mapped, there are two types of functors: the *covariant* functors \\(\mathcal{F} _{\mathrm{cov}}\\) have the arrows of the morhpisms unchanged; the *contravariant* functors \\(\mathcal{F} _{\mathrm{ctr}}\\) have the arrows of the morphisms inverted.

## Example: pushforward and pullback
For example, in differential geometry, we can have the first category be the category of pointed manifolds (manifolds with a point on it as a tuple) with the morphisms being smooth maps between manifolds. Our second category is the category of tangent spaces, the morhpisms are pushforward maps. A covariant functor maps each pointed manifold to a tangent space, and maps the smooth maps between manifolds into the pushforward maps between tangent spaces.

If the third category contains the cotangent spaces, the morphisms will then be pullback maps. A contravariant functor maps each pointed manifold to a cotangent space, with smooth maps between manifolds mapped to pullback maps between cotangent spaces and the direction of the arrows are inverted.

# Some extra stuffs
## Sheaves
The tangent bundle is a prototype for sheaves. In the language of vector bundles, we have a manifold as a base space. On each point over the base space, one has a vector space as the fiber. Collecting all the fibers, one obtains a bundle.

Similarly, in the language of sheaves, the base space can be more general such as rings or fields. The fibers over each point are now replaced by the name *stalks*. The collections of the stalks forms the sheaf.

## Homology
Homology is the study of how close a chain is to an exact sequence. In an exact sequence
<p>

$$
A_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} A_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} A_3,
$$
</p>
it is required that \\(\mathrm{im}(d_1) = \mathrm{ker}(d_2)\\). However, for homology, all that is required is that \\(\mathrm{d}_2\circ\mathrm{d}_1 = 0\\). We can characterize how close a homology is from the exact sequence by taking the quotient of the two sets.

As for cohomology, we consider the chain of duals to that of homology. The directions of the arrows are of course inverted. However, we are again measuring how close it is to an exact sequence via taking its quotients.

## Miscellaneous stuff
The results in differential geometry has a near one-to-one correspondence in number theory as well via sheaves. Some interesting to study is the link between homotopy and homology, as well as arithmetic number theory.
