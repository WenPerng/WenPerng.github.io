This is a series of posts on connecting techniques of differential geometry and signal processing over graphs. For more details, one can refer to the paper "[Topological Signal Processing Over Simplicial Complexes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9044758)" by S. Barbarossa and S. Sardellitti.

In the [previous post](/posts/2025/09/blog-post-14/), we addressed the basic notations to simplices over graphs.
