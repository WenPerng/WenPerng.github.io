excerpt: "This is a series of post connecting differential geometry with signal processing over graphs. This post specifically addresses the notion of differential operator over graphs and graph Laplacians."

This is a series of posts on connecting techniques of differential geometry and signal processing over graphs. For more details, one can refer to the paper "[Topological Signal Processing Over Simplicial Complexes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9044758)" by S. Barbarossa and S. Sardellitti.

In the [previous post](/posts/2025/09/blog-post-14/), we addressed the basic notations to simplices over graphs.
This second post of the series

# Incidence matrix
Next, we consider signals on the simplices. A signal on \\(k\\)-simplices is denoted by \\(s^k\\). Assume there are \\(n\\) \\(k\\)-simplices, then \\(s^k \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times1}\\).

Next, let us introduce the incidence matrix \\(B_k\\) operating on signals on \\(k\\)-simplices, mapping them to signals on \\((k-1)\\)-simplices. The incidence matrix operates as the *boundary* operation, mapping \\(k\\)-chains to \\((k-1)\\)-chains.

Consider the one-hot vector \\(\boldsymbol{1} _{\sigma^k _i}\\) representing the \\(i\\)th \\(k\\)-simplex, we want
<p>

$$
B_k \boldsymbol{1}_{\sigma^k_i} = \boldsymbol{1}_{\partial_k\sigma^k_i}.
$$
</p>

Formally, the entries to \\(B_k\\) are defined as
<p>

$$
\boxed{
    [B_k]_{ij} = \begin{cases}
        +1, & \sigma^{k-1}_i \subset \sigma^k_j \text{ and } \sigma^{k-1}_i \sim \sigma^k_j \\
        -1, & \sigma^{k-1}_i \subset \sigma^k_j \text{ and } \sigma^{k-1}_i \not\sim \sigma^k_j \\
        0, & \sigma^{k-1}_i \not\subset \sigma^k_j.
    \end{cases}
}
$$
</p>

From the [property](/posts/2025/09/blog-post-14/) of the boundary operation, we have that
<p>

$$
B_{k-1} B_{k} = 0.
$$
</p>

The incidence matrix represents the *adjacency* information between the simplices.

# Graph Laplacian
The combinatorial Laplacian matrix acting on signals over \\(k\\)-simplices is defined as
<p>

$$
\boxed{
    L_k = B_k^{\mathsf{T}} B_k + B_{k+1} B_{k+1}^{\mathsf{T}}
}.
$$
</p>
The first component \\(B _k^{\mathsf{T}} B _k\\) is the *lower Laplacian*, representing the *lower adjacency*; while the latter component \\(B _{k+1} B _{k+1}^{\mathsf{T}}\\) is the *upper Laplacian*, representing the *upper adjacency*.

I will postpone the discussion as to why it is defined so until I can present an easy to understand explanation. But for the mean time, I am simply surprised by the elegance and simplicity of the representation, as it greatly mirrors its differential geometrical counterpart -- the Laplace--Beltrami operator.

With the Laplacian, one can perform Fourier transform on the signals by a coordinate transform with respect to the eigenbasis of the Laplacian.

Moreover, the Hodge decomposition of differential forms may also be introduced. For a thorough discussion, however, some knowledge on differential geometry is required. So I guess I will postpone the related discussion to the far future.

I decided to learn about topological signal processing as I was preparing for the [talk on Fourier transform](https://wenperng.github.io/talks/2025-05-15-talk). This is such an interesting topic, but I have to find some applications to it so as to push myself in learning it.
