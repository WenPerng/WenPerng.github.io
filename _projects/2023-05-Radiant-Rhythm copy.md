> This is a final project for the course \"Numerical Methods\" given in the spring of 2023 by Prof. [Snow H. Tseng](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37981986900).

Using MATLAB, I developed a ray tracing engine. Using the engine, I presented the light tracing of a metallic chaotic pendulum.

Sadly, the code is in my old laptop... which has its chargers lost. I'll reupload the codes once I have figured out a way to obtain the files in my old laptop.
