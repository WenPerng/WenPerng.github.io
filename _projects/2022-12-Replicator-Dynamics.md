excerpt: "This project analyzes the stability of games under the replicator dynamics. Special attention is given in dynamics where players take \"surprises\" into consideration, which acts as a perturbation. *Final project for the course \"Information, Control and Games\" given in the fall of 2022 by Prof. [Shi-Chung Chang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37351456900).*"

> This is a list of presentations and reports for the course "Information, Control and Games" given in the fall of 2022 by Prof. [Shi-Chung Chang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37351456900).

This course is about, in essence, game theory. Agents of the game are often given incomplete information and are forced to present the best responses to optimize their respective goals. Hence the course name.

# Paper Survey
To help students come up with a topic for final project, each student must present a survey in topics provided by Prof. Chang in the first few weeks of the semester..

I presented a modified version to the [slides](https://wnzhang.net/tutorials/marl2018/docs/lecture-2b-repeated-games.pdf) by Prof. Jun Wang from UCL. The slides of my presentation are as below.

# Project Proposal
Of the topics I presented, I find "replicator dynamics" the most interesting. One can find the [slides](/files/slides/projects/2022_Replicator_Dynamics_proposal_slides.pdf) and [report](/files/pdfs/projects/2022_Replicator_Dynamics_proposal.pdf) to my project proposal by clicking the links.

Near the third quarter of the semester, a progress report was also presented. The [slides](/files/slides/projects/2022_Replicator_Dynamics_progress_slides.pdf) can be found by clicking the link.

# Project Report
The final project report and the presentation slides are as below.

The project investigates into the stability of a repeated game under the strategy of replicator dynamics, where each player copies the strategies of those that succeed in the previous round.

Using analysis methods of linear systems, one is able to establish the stability or instability of stationary points of the system. The specific cases of a rock-paper-scissor game and game of chicken are considered.

Lastly, for games in which the population do not converge to the unique Nash equilibrium, I considered the inclusion of a scaled entropy term as a perturbation to the game dynamics. This can be explained by players taking "surprises" into consideration of next-round strategies.

The code to the simulations are also provided at the end of the report.
