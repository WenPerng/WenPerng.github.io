> This is a final project for the course \"Time-Frequency Analysis and Wavelet Transform\" given in the fall of 2023 by Prof. [Jian-Jiun Ding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279610700).

I am long interested in the relation between ray and wave optics. To be frank, I was never satisfied with what I learned in class.

During my apprenticeship at Prof. [Lon A. Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336939900)'s lab in the summer of 2022, I found out the relation between the one-dimensional linear canonical transformation with symmetric optical systems ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_canonical_transformation#Applications)). I was unsatisfied as to not being able to find an explanation to why it works except that it simply does.

In the course \"Time-Frequency Analysis and Wavelet Transform,\" the linear canonical transformation was brought up again, and many of the mathematical details were glossed over. I found it to be the perfect time for me to go through the problem I had once again and fully understand it.

Thus came this final project. My favorite part is Appendix B in the final report.
