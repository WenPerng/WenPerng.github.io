> This is a review of the paper \"[Optimisation Geometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1775)\" by Jonathan H. Manton, which serves as the *final presentation for the course \"Manifold Optimisation for Representation Learning\" given in the summer of 2024 by Prof. [Hao Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kce9W-8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Julian Wörmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=aqG8AJcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).*

This talk is about how the geometric notion of fibre bundles (note the British spelling for many of the words here, as Jonathan H. Manton, the author of the work, is from Australia) and fibre-wise Morse functions can be used to design homotopy-based optimisation algorithms.

The talk is brief, covering the basic ideas of the geometry required and how it naturally induces a homotopy-based algorithm simply by following a *section* termed the fibre-wise critical points across different base points of the fibre bundle.
