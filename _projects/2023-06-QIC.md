> This is a final project for the course \"Quantum Information and Computation\" given in the spring of 2023 by Prof. [Hao-Chung Cheng](http://www.hao-chung.info/).

In that semester, I was deeply fascinated by the mathematics of geometric (Clifford) algebra, hence this topic was formed.

Not to be confused with algebraic geometry, geometric algebra is in essence the tensor algebra with some extensions. After the project was finished, I realized that the geometric-algebraic formulation of quantum computation is in fact just the quaternionic formulation, albeit with a more general / interpretable notation. Sadly, the reformulation contains no new insights that can be utilized as far as I can see.

Nevertheless, the report is still included here for others to see how NOT to tread a seemingly popular path. Jokes on me though, the video above going through our report results is one of the most liked and viewed videos on my channel.
