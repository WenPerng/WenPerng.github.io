excerpt: "This project focusses on giving an intuitive but rigorous derivation of Fourier optics, including many of the complicated integrals related to Hankel transform, and we also dicussed a couple of its applications. *Final project for the course \"Fundamentals of Electro-Optics\" given in the spring of 2022 by Prof. [Lon A.

> This is a final project for the course \"Fundamentals of Electro-Optics\" given in the spring of 2022 by Prof. [Lon A. Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336939900). My contributions include section 1, 2, 3.1, and 3.3.

As a freshman student who have taken calculus and a bit of complex analysis during the previous semester, it is without a doubt that the mathematics of Fourier optics fascinate us. Not to mention that during the same semester, we have also taken the course *Signals and Systems* where we used Fourier transform extensively.

This project serves to elucidate the missing mathematical details regarding Fourier optics and its applications that were omitted in the lecture.

The final report starts off with an intuitive but also mathematically rigorous derivation of the main result that relates optical imaging with Fourier transform.

The second section serves specifically to derive the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. The mathematics is a bit difficult here as we used tools from complex analysis (namely, the Cauchy integral formula) to facilitate the discussions of Hankel transform and Bessel functions.

The third section introduces three applications of Fourier optics:
1. Finding the structure of DNA from its pattern. This is the famous result first obtained by Franklin Rosalind in 1953.
2. Fresnel zone plate. Using specially designed phase patterns to create a 2D plate with lens-like optical property.
3. Reciprocal lattice. A mathematical tool used especially for the analysis of crystal diffraction patterns.

The project produces both a video (see above) and a PDF report (see below).
