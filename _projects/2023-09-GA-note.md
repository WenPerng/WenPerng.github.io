excerpt: "Note compilation for the study group lectures on geometric algebra."
---

This is a semester experimental study group on "Geometric (Clifford) Algebra."

Inspired by the beauty of conformal geometric algebra in solving inverse kinematics problem as well as its interpretation and easy manipulation, my friend [Wei-Hsuan Cheng](https://wei-hsuan-cheng.github.io/) (who specializes in CGA) and I decided to prepare a series of lecture talks on the fundamentals of geometric algebra. The talks ends in the culmination of the application of conformal geometric algebra in robotics.
