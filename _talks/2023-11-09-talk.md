How can we describe rotation? Besides the usual rotational matrices, this talk gives an introduction to the Lie algebra of the group \\(\mathrm{SO}(3)\\), and connects it with its double cover, the quaternions. The mathematics to the quaternions are further explained and motivated by the geometric algebra (Clifford algebra) over \\(\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).
