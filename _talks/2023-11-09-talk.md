# About the Talk

This talk starts off our introduction to rotation through the matrix group of three-dimensional rotation, \\(\mathrm{SO}(3)\\), that we are so used to seeing. Via some demos ([axis-angle](https://www.desmos.com/3d/c954b491f0?lang=zh-TW), [fix-axis](https://www.desmos.com/3d/f34fea4dd2?lang=zh-TW)), we are able to visualize the non-trivial aspects of rotations -- its non-commutativity.

After that, as a bridge between what is to come, I give a short detour into the *infinitesimal generator* of rotation, i.e., its *Lie algebra* \\(\mathfrak{so}(3)\\).

The numerical instability an unwieldiness of the rotation matrices leads us to the introduction of quaternions:
\\[q = a + b\mathrm{i} + c\mathrm{j} + d\mathrm{k} \in \mathbb{H}.\\]
Its simplicity in describing rotation and interpolation between rotations is what we seek. In fact, in many animation softwares, this is what we currently use. Another [demo](https://www.desmos.com/3d/6b5c1e91d4?lang=zh-TW) is given. However, it is infamous for the difficulty in understanding them.

Therefore, as a closing to the talk, we introduce the geometric algebra (Clifford algebra) over \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\), denoted by \\(\mathcal{G}_{3}\\). The elements in the geometric algebra, residing in \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\), help us *visualize* what rotation actually is. Drawing the equivalence between grade-2 bivectors of geometric algebra with the quaternions, we are able to understand how quaternions describe rotations.
