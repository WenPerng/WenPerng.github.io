How can we describe rotation? Besides the usual rotational matrices, this talk goes over the quaternionic and geometric algebraic description of rotation.

This talk starts off of our introduction to rotation via the usual matrix group of three-dimensional rotation, \\(\mathrm{SO}(3)\\). Via some demos ([axis-angle](https://www.desmos.com/3d/c954b491f0?lang=zh-TW), [fix-axis](https://www.desmos.com/3d/f34fea4dd2?lang=zh-TW)), we are able to visualize the non-trivial aspects of rotations -- its non-commutativity.

After that, as a bridge between what is to come, I give a short detour into the *infinitesimal generator* of rotation, i.e., its *Lie algebra* \\(\mathfrak{so}(3)\\).

The numerical instability an unwieldiness of the rotation matrices leads us to the introduction of quaternions:
\\[q = a + b\mathrm{i} + c\mathrm{j} + d\mathrm{k} \in \mathbb{H}.\\]
Its simplicity in describing rotation and interpolation between rotations is what we seek. In fact, in many animation softwares, this is what we currently use. Another [demo](https://www.desmos.com/3d/6b5c1e91d4?lang=zh-TW) is given. However, it is infamous for the difficulty in understanding them.

Therefore, as a closing to the talk, we introduced the geometric algebra (Clifford algebra) over \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\), denoted by \\(\mathcal{G}_{3}\\). The elements in the geometric algebra, residing in \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\), help us *visualize* what rotation actually is. Drawing the equivalence between grade-2 bivectors of geometric algebra with the quaternions, we are able to understand how quaternions describe rotations.
