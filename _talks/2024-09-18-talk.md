Again, this talk starts off from the notion of treating derivatives as a linear operator mapping the changes in the variable to the first-order changes in the function (Fréchet Derivative).

A more rigorous definition to finding matrix derivatives via *directional derivatives* is given. This definition is crucial in leading to manifold optimization, which is the next talk. Furthermore, it also justified the form of a differentiation of a scalar function by a matrix, which was glossed over in its introduction from the previous talk on matrix differentiation in 2023.

Drawing inspiration from the Taylor expansion, the gradient and Hessian are also rigorously defined. They are treated, again, as an operator defined so with respect to an inner product. Usually, the Euclidean inner product is assumed.

Examples of applications of matrix differentiation are given near the end of the talk. As a taste of freshness, I demonstrate how backpropagation is used in the training of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This also motivates the need for ResNet, to combat against the diminishing of gradient.
