What is Fourier transform? Besides the usual Fourier transform defined over \\(\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\mathbb{Z}\\), this talks introduces the notion of Fourier transform over groups, fields, and graphs. Further, a slight taste of distribution theory is provided to make our usual applications of Fourier transform in engineering mathematics more rigorous.

The usual Fourier transforms introduced in the course *Signals and Systems* are those defined over \\(\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\mathbb{T}\\), \\(\mathbb{Z}\\), and \\([N]\\), with the first one written as
\\[ \hat{f}(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} 2\pi kx} \mathrm{d}x .\\]
In essence, the Fourier transform is just a unitary transformation between two sets of orthogonal coordinates. This viewpoint of the Fourier transform is emphasized.

Next, as a taste of the mathematics that is to come, we gave an introduction to the matrix representation of DTFS and its two-dimensional variant -- the Fourier transform of an image. The multi-dimensional Fourier transform, on the other hand, leads to the famous Fourier slice theorem that is used in the mathematics of a CT scan.

In this talk, I give three different aspects of the Fourier transform: the traditional one, the Fourier transform defined over rings, and the Fourier transform defined over graphs.

**About NTUEE SAAD Theoretical Talks**

The student academic association department (SAAD), NTUEE, is a student-run association under the electrical engineering department of National Taiwan University. It organizes events and courses such as this theoretical talk to bachelor students in the department.

The theoretical talks target at students with an interest in the more theoretical and mathematical aspects of engineering.
